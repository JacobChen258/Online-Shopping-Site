## Journals

#### Day 1 (Dec 22, 2021)
In order to have a big picture of how to implement the project from scratch, I am setting today's goal as to learn the basics and logics under the hook of three languages JS, HTML and CSS, and review software design, network models. 
Then, doing researches about how to build an application and server. If there are still time left, I will look up some databases that are suitable for this project.

Summary of the day : Java script is a very power language which supports both front-end and back-end programming, also it is an object-oriented language as well as functional language. HTML is like the skeleton of a website and CSS adds up a lot of amazing features on that skeleton. 

Plan for Day 2: In order to remember the front-end knowlege, I will build the main page of the website and some other pages like user profile, product page.
