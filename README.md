Some functionality that is good to have will be the recommendation system.

#### learning goals
Learn the major languages will be used in this project from zero to proficient, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
Practice Software design, system design and network in project.
Getting to know how different APIs collaborate with each other to build a complete product.

## Journals

#### Day 1 (Dec 22, 2021)
In order to have a big picture of how to implement the project from scratch, I am setting today's goal as to learn the basics and logics under the hook of three languages JS, HTML and CSS, and review software design, network models. 
Then, doing researches about how to build an application and server. If there are still time left, I will look up some databases that are suitable for this project.

Summary of the day : Java script is a very power language which supports both front-end and back-end programming, also it is an object-oriented language as well as functional language. HTML is like the skeleton of a website and CSS adds up a lot of amazing features on that skeleton. 

Plan for Day 2: In order to remember the front-end knowlege, I will build the main page of the website and some other pages like user profile, product page.

#### Day 2 (Dec 23, 2021)
There are many obstacles about the grid layout which I did not understand the logic in depth. So the progress today is quite minimal.

The lack of comprehensive knowledge made me only finished the top search bar interface. Comparing with the plan made on Dec 22, there is still more than half of the work to do in order to go to the JavaScript step.

Plan for Day 3: Since I will be working in the next 3 days, I will count the next 3 days as 1 days. Understand grid layout and complete the tasks left from Day2.

#### Day 3 (Dec 27,2021)
The main page of website has completed. 

As I have some degree of familarity to the front end programming from building the main page, I will start to design the back architecture.

Plan for Day 4: determine the language and framework I will be using for the website. Decide the scope of minimum viable product. From the scope defined, highlight the techniques and algorithms will be using for the website.

#### Day 4 (Dec 28,2021)
Choice of frame works:
    Front-end: React (JS)
    Front to Server Communication: Express (JS)
    Server: Django (Python)
    Database Language: PostgreSQL

Complete the ERD database design and set up schema, tables and indexes in the postgreSQL server.
