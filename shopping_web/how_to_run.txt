To run the django framwork,
    each time after we modified the code
        `python ./manage.py makemigrations`
        to detect changes
    After updated all changes 
        `python ./manage.py migrate`
    Then,
        `python ./manage.py runserver`
        this will give us an url to the web server
        enter the url from browser to see web page.

To run the frontend,
    after backend server is running
    go to frontend dir, run
        `npm run dev` (this will run the dev mode defined in pakage.json)
